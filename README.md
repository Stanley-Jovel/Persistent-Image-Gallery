# Persistent Image Gallery
Project [Assignment #6 of "Developing iOS apps course" CS193P](https://github.com/duliodenis/cs193p-Fall-2017/blob/master/problemsets/Programming_Project_6_Persistent_Image_Gallery.pdf) from Stanford university

This is the improved version of my previous assignment: [Image Gallery](https://github.com/Stanley-Jovel/Image-Gallery) with
* Document View Controller integration (creating, renaming, deleting files)
* more readable code
* better code structure
